💡 Usage Examples
Example 1: Network Security Audit
1. Launch multitool.exe as Administrator
2. Select: 3 (Network & Security Tools)
3. Select: 1 (Advanced Port Scanner)
4. Enter target: 192.168.1.1
5. View results:

[+] Port 22 OPEN  │ Banner: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1
[+] Port 80 OPEN  │ Banner: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
[+] Port 443 OPEN │ Banner: nginx/1.18.0
Why this matters: Banner grabbing reveals exact software versions, allowing you to search for known CVEs.

Example 2: Malware Hash Analysis
1. Select: 5 (Cryptographic Tools)
2. Select: 1 (File Hash Calculator)
3. Enter file: C:\Downloads\suspicious.exe
4. Results:

[+] MD5:    5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
[+] SHA256: 2c26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae
Next step: Search hash on VirusTotal to check if file is known malware.

Example 3: DLL Hijacking Detection
1. Select: 6 (Forensics & Analysis)
2. Select: 1 (Process Memory Inspector)
3. View output:

[PID: 1234] svchost.exe
  Memory: 45 MB
  Loaded DLLs (8): ntdll.dll, kernel32.dll, C:\Temp\evil.dll ⚠️
Red flag: Legitimate system processes shouldn't load DLLs from C:\Temp

Example 4: Deobfuscate PowerShell
1. Select: 5 (Cryptographic Tools)
2. Select: 2 (Base64 Encoder/Decoder)
3. Choose: 2 (Decode)
4. Enter: cG93ZXJzaGVsbCAtZXhlYyBieXBhc3M=
5. Result: powershell -exec bypass
Use case: Malware often uses Base64 to hide malicious commands.

Example 5: Secure Evidence Deletion
1. Select: 4 (File Operations)
2. Select: 3 (Secure Delete)
3. Enter path: C:\Temp\sensitive_document.txt
4. Confirm: yes

[*] Initiating secure deletion...
  Pass 1/3 complete
  Pass 2/3 complete
  Pass 3/3 complete
[+] File securely deleted
Technical: Each pass overwrites entire file with random data, preventing forensic recovery.

🔨 Compilation
Method 1: Visual Studio (MSVC)
cmdREM Production build with maximum security
cl /EHsc /std:c++17 /O2 /GS /DYNAMICBASE /NXCOMPAT /SAFESEH ^
   /guard:cf /sdl multitool_pro.cpp ^
   /link ws2_32.lib urlmon.lib shlwapi.lib pdh.lib psapi.lib
Security flags:

/GS - Stack buffer overrun detection
/DYNAMICBASE - ASLR (randomize memory layout)
/NXCOMPAT - DEP (non-executable stack)
/guard:cf - Control Flow Guard (prevent ROP attacks)


Method 2: MinGW-w64 (GCC)
bash# Production build
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra \
    -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-strong \
    -fPIE -pie -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now \
    multitool_pro.cpp -o multitool.exe \
    -lws2_32 -lurlmon -lshlwapi -lpdh -lpsapi

# Debug build with sanitizers
g++ -std=c++17 -g -O0 -fsanitize=address,leak,undefined \
    multitool_pro.cpp -o multitool_debug.exe \
    -lws2_32 -lurlmon -lshlwapi -lpdh -lpsapi

Method 3: CMake (Recommended)
Create CMakeLists.txt:
cmakecmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(CyberSecMultitool)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

if(MSVC)
    add_compile_options(/W4 /GS /guard:cf)
    add_link_options(/DYNAMICBASE /NXCOMPAT)
else()
    add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -fstack-protector-strong)
    add_link_options(-pie -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now)
endif()

add_executable(multitool multitool_pro.cpp)
target_link_libraries(multitool ws2_32 urlmon shlwapi pdh psapi)
Build:
bashmkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Issue: Port scanner shows no results
Solution:
powershell# Check firewall
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles

# Test with ping first
ping <target_ip>

# Ensure target is reachable
Issue: "Access Denied" errors
Solution: Run as Administrator
cmdRight-click multitool.exe → Run as administrator
Issue: ANSI colors not displaying
Solution: Use Windows Terminal instead of cmd.exe
powershell# Install Windows Terminal from Microsoft Store
# Or download from: https://aka.ms/terminal
Issue: Antivirus flags the tool
Solution: Add exclusion (common for security tools)
powershellAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Path\To\Tool"
Issue: Memory usage high during scan
Solution: Normal behavior - thread pool allocates memory upfront
Expected: ~50MB during active scans
Returns to ~10MB when idle
Debug Mode
Compile with sanitizers:
bashg++ -fsanitize=address,leak -g multitool_pro.cpp -o debug.exe
./debug.exe
# Any memory issues will be reported
View encrypted logs:
cpp// Decrypt debug.log
std::ifstream log("debug.log", std::ios::binary);
std::string data((std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(log)), {});
for(char& c : data) c ^= 0x5A;  // XOR key
std::cout << data;
